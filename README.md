A list of my favorite katas somewhat ranked by difficulty

## What is a kata?
A kata is a small digestible fun exercise that lets you practice things. You can focus on stuff like tdd, or breaking the problem up better, or single responsibility. Itâ€™s a simple enough problem that you can do real practice without getting bogged down in the domain, deadlines, or delivery.

Focus on form and mastery here!

## Interested in TDD?

**What is TDD?**

TDD stands for Test Driven *Design*. It is a tool to help design understandable, maintainable, and easy to use components in a system. Although not the immediate goal, after the test has been written, it has the side effect of regression safety.

**The Three Dogmatic Laws of TDD**

- You can't write any production code until you have first written a failing unit test.
- You can't write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail, and not compiling is failing.
- You can't write more production code than is sufficient to pass the currently failing unit test.
